# 0x02. Session Authentication

## BACKGROUND CONTEXT
**Session authentication is designed to address the limitations of the stateless nature of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. In the early days of the internet, each HTTP request from a user's browser to a web server was independent, lacking any inherent connection or context. However, as the need for personalized user experiences grew, maintaining context across multiple requests became essential.**
